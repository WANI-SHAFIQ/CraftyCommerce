  - **Pull Requests:** Provides a structured approach for reviewing and integrating changes, even if they are simulated.
  - **Conflict Resolution:** Regularly updating branches from the main branch ensures that all simulated developments are consistent and conflicts are minimized.
  - **Commit Practices:** Even with dummy files, maintaining descriptive commits and a clean project history is valuable for tracking progress.

This documentation outlines the purpose of each branch, the simulated features, and the lessons learned from using Git for version control and collaboration.
